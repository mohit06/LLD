The task management system should allow users to create, update, and delete tasks.
Each task should have a title, description, due date, priority, and status (e.g., pending, in progress, completed).
Users should be able to assign tasks to other users and set reminders for tasks.
The system should support searching and filtering tasks based on various criteria (e.g., priority, due date, assigned user).
Users should be able to mark tasks as completed and view their task history.
The system should handle concurrent access to tasks and ensure data consistency.
The system should be extensible to accommodate future enhancements and new features.

Possible patterns that can be used:
Singleton for TaskManager.
Builder for creating Task Object.
Specification Pattern for filtering/searching.
Observer Pattern may be used to send notification/reminder. But I think it is better to schedule the method to execute at set time instead of using observer because no one is observing here.
But if more than 1 users needs to get a reminder then we can use Observer Pattern.
